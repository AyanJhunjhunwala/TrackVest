# TrackVest

Track any investment category — traditional (equities, ETFs, crypto) and non‑traditional (real estate prospects, collectibles, angel checks, creator deals, even your friend’s animatronic piñata startup).

Ask natural‑language questions like:

“Did I miss out on buying that house last year with the interest rates?”

“Is it a good idea to invest in my friend’s animatronic piñata startup?”

Generate custom charts on your Insights page (technical indicators for stocks/crypto with a quick prompt).

Leverage news‑based signals while you’re away — Trackvest watches headlines and market data to surface what matters.

(Roadmap) Agentic investing: define goals & risk limits → agents propose or execute actions you approve.
